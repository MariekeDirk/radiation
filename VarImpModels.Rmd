## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
models<-list.files("/nobackup/users/dirksen/radiation/Rdata/MLmodels/finalModels/",full.names = T)

print(models)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r varimp}
md<-readRDS(models[4])

varImp(md)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
